Welcome to the SCADA folder. This folder contains the code to pre-process these data following the methods described in the associated publication. Due to its size, 
the raw dataset has been archived as an open-source .csv at Iowa Research Online.
If you want to skip pre-processing, use the "SCADA.csv" file directly to begin building models.
